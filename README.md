# Hi there! :wave:

- I am curious guy having fun as well as on backend 🦾 and frontend 💻 tasks.
- Mostly I do C++, but I see the language more as a tool to create something awesome.
- I enjoy Rust 🦀: It is tough but still awesome and I think it is the future for many SW related things.

You will find me on different places [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andreas-heimberger/), [xing](https://www.xing.com/profile/Andreas_Heimberger4), ... Maybe not so active, because I also need to enjoy mother nature 🐻🌳. Whatever is valuable to you, life is too short 🍃, so live every day as if it were your last.
